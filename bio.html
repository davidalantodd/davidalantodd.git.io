                <p>Hello! My name is David (he/him) and I’m one of the Software Engineering Coaches on the US 
                    team. I was born and raised in Ellicott City, MD (near Baltimore), and I currently reside 
                    in the Boston, MA area.</p>    
                <p>Prior to Multiverse, I worked as a higher education administrator 
                    at several universities where I found my passion for helping and mentoring students as they
                    developed new skills. As a queer, multiracial person with immigrant parents (from the 
                    Cayman Islands and the UK), I gravitate toward places where I can be authentically me 
                    and opportunities which allow me to work toward equity, inclusion, and social justice. 
                    I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a dual degree in Computer
                    Science and Theatre and wasn’t exactly sure what I wanted to do next. </p>
                <p> After being heavily involved in student leadership opportunities on campus, I earned a master's 
                    degree in College Student Affairs Administration from the University of Georgia. 
                    I pursued this career path partly because I didn’t feel I belonged in the tech space.
                    Building relationships with students, creating transformative learning experiences, 
                    and teaching leadership and teamwork skills was rewarding and impactful. However, 
                    after learning about Multiverse’s mission to prepare a diverse group of future 
                    leaders and democratize access to great career opportunities… I wanted to be part of it!</p>
                <p>I look forward to using my experiences in education and computer science to help 
                    apprentices find their place in tech, gain the confidence to pursue their careers 
                    in software engineering, and do all of this while being their true selves. Outside 
                    of Multiverse, I enjoy spending time outside hiking and birding with my partner 
                    and dog, singing and appreciating music (especially musical theatre!), traveling with
                        friends, going to the beach, and catching up on the latest season of RuPaul’s 
                        Drag Race. I can’t wait to get to know you!
                    </p>
