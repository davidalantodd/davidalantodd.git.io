                <p>Hello! My name is David (he/him) and I'm a Software Engineering Coach at Multiverse. I was born and raised in Ellicott City, MD and I currently live in Boston, MA.</p>
                <p>I have always had an interest in the intersection of people and technology. I attended the University of Maryland and earned a dual degree in Computer Science and Theatre. After college, I pursued a master's degree at the University of Georgia to become a higher education administrator. I spent several years creating learning experiences, developing collaborative teams, and implementing new software to streamline processes. In the next phase of my career, I knew I wanted to combine my knowledge of computer science with my experiences in education.</p>
                <p>I haven't always felt a sense of belonging in the tech field. As someone who is queer and multiracial with immigrant parents (from the Cayman Islands and the UK), I seek out spaces where authenticity, equity, and social justice are valued. After learning about Multiverse's mission to prepare a diverse group of future leaders and democratize access to great career opportunitiesâ€¦ I wanted to be part of it! I am energized by helping apprentices gain the skills and confidence to develop as software engineers, find their place in tech, and do all of this while being their true selves.</p>
                <p>Outside of Multiverse, I enjoy spending time birding and gardening with my partner and dog, staying active, singing and listening to music (especially musical theatre), traveling to see friends and family, and watching some good TV (some favorites are RuPaul's Drag Race, Survivor, Abbott Elementary, and Bob's Burgers).</p>
